## 1. core philosophy: freedom first
- freedom over comfort
  - freedom of action matters more than convenience, popularity, or approval
- independence is structural
  - real freedom comes from removing dependencies, not negotiating with them
- principles > short-term wins
  - compromise compounds; once crossed, lines cannot be redrawn
- exit optionality matters
  - the ability to walk away preserves autonomy

## 2. money, success, and fame
- money is a tool, not a goal
  - wealth attracts pressure from states, investors, and public opinion
- no ads, no shareholders
  - every external stakeholder becomes a potential lever of control
- skeptical of fame
  - attention distorts incentives and decision-making
- optionality > valuation
  - maximal scale can trap founders more than it frees them

## 3. work, creativity, and building
- small teams outperform large ones
  - coordination cost grows faster than productivity
- automation over headcount
  - more people often create internal friction, not better products
- deep, uninterrupted work
  - originality requires silence and long focus windows
- products over narratives
  - real utility spreads without persuasion or hype

## 4. privacy, encryption, and trust
- privacy is a human right
  - not a feature toggle or marketing claim
- no backdoors, ever
  - any “lawful access” becomes a universal vulnerability
- security must be technical
  - promises are meaningless without architectural guarantees
- integrity over market access
  - better to exit a country than weaken user protections

## 5. censorship, states, and power
- states default to control
  - surveillance expands under the language of safety and order
- democracies are not immune
  - censorship now arrives via ids, age checks, and content scanning
- political neutrality is non-negotiable
  - once a platform chooses sides, trust collapses
- the free internet is fragile
  - openness erodes quietly, step by step

## 6. apple, google, and platform control
- app stores are chokepoints
  - os owners can silence apps indirectly
- platform dependence is a kill switch
  - removal or throttling equals functional censorship
- closed ecosystems prioritize control
  - convenience is exchanged for user autonomy
- freedom requires alternatives
  - web access, decentralization, and redundancy matter

## 7. health, discipline, and lifestyle
- total abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, drugs
  - clarity and long-term productivity over stimulation
- avoid pills unless necessary
  - pharmaceuticals often mask root causes like sleep or stress
- simple, clean diet
  - no fast food, minimal sugar; mostly seafood and vegetables
- intermittent fasting
  - discipline, mental sharpness, metabolic stability
- cold exposure (banya, ice baths)
  - deliberate discomfort to train stress resilience
- regular intense physical activity
  - clearer thinking, lower anxiety
- discipline equals freedom
  - fewer cravings mean fewer control points

## 8. personal life design
- high geographic mobility
  - reduces coercion by any single state
- minimalism
  - fewer possessions, fewer anchors
- extreme personal privacy
  - beliefs must align with behavior
- avoid passive algorithmic feeds
  - recommender systems manipulate attention and emotion

## 9. unifying logic
- dependency → leverage → control
- discipline → independence → freedom
- centralization → censorship → loss of trust
