biohacking is about aligning with biology, not forcing extremes

it is mostly about removing friction, not adding hacks

consistency beats novelty every time

### core principles

- fix sleep, light, food, movement, stress before supplements
- measure only what you can act on
- avoid injections, experimental drugs, or extreme interventions
- favor habits with long human safety records
- stop anything that worsens sleep, anxiety, or recovery

### sleep (highest roi)

- sleep is the foundation everything stacks on
- fixed wake-up time > fixed bedtime
- morning sunlight within 30–60 minutes of waking
- no bright or overhead light 2–3 hours before bed
- cool, dark, quiet bedroom
- caffeine cutoff 8–10 hours before sleep
- alcohol framed as a sleep disruptor, not relaxation

#### circadian rhythm

- light is the primary biological clock
- outdoor daylight beats light boxes when possible
- dim evenings support melatonin release
- late-night screens = artificial jet lag
- consistent meal timing reinforces circadian alignment

### nutrition

- fewer rules, more signal
- whole foods over supplements
- protein sufficiency for muscle, satiety, glucose stability
- fiber for gut and metabolic health
- minimize ultra-processed foods rather than chasing superfoods
- time-restricted eating used cautiously, not dogmatically
- hydration guided by thirst + urine color

#### glucose awareness (without obsession)

- glucose spikes are context-dependent, not moral failures
- walking after meals improves glucose handling
- pairing carbs with protein/fat blunts spikes
- avoid anxiety-driven continuous tracking

### exercise (the real backbone)

#### movement baseline

- daily movement is non-negotiable
- steps and light activity matter even if you train
- long sitting blocks blunt metabolic health

#### resistance training / lifting

- primary goal: preserve and build muscle mass
- muscle = metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, longevity
- 2–4 sessions per week is sufficient
- compound movements prioritized (squat, hinge, push, pull, carry)
- progressive overload > novelty
- form and consistency beat ego lifting

#### cardio

- cardio is for heart, mitochondria, and brain
- not all cardio is the same

##### zone 2 cardio

- low to moderate intensity, conversational pace
- improves mitochondrial density and fat oxidation
- 2–4 hours per week total
- examples: brisk walking, cycling, easy jogging, rowing

##### high-intensity cardio

- short, hard efforts raise cardiovascular ceiling
- improves vo2 max
- 1–2 sessions per week max
- excessive hiit = stress accumulation

#### vo2 max

- one of the strongest predictors of lifespan and healthspan
- reflects heart, lung, blood, and muscle integration
- improves via intervals, hills, mixed endurance + strength
- progress stalls without sleep and recovery

### recovery

- adaptation happens during rest, not training
- sleep, calories, and protein enable gains
- soreness is not a success metric

#### stress & nervous system

- chronic stress treated as a root cause
- slow nasal breathing > complex breath protocols
- regular time without digital input
- social safety and trust affect biology

#### cold & heat exposure

- cold exposure as mild hormetic stress, not fat-loss magic
- short cold showers over extreme ice rituals
- sauna for relaxation, cardiovascular support, sleep quality
- recovery prioritized over suffering

### fat loss (honest framing)

- fat loss requires a sustained energy deficit
- exercise supports fat loss, diet adherence matters more
- muscle preservation is the priority while cutting

### extended fasting (strategic use only)

- extended fasting can reduce fat mass and improve insulin sensitivity
- higher risk, higher reward tool
- not required for most people

#### who it may suit

- metabolically unhealthy individuals
- people with significant fat to lose
- those with prior fasting experience

#### who should avoid

- underweight individuals
- eating disorder history
- high training volume athletes
- poor sleep or high stress baselines

#### protocol basics

- typically 36–72 hours, not weeks
- water intake is mandatory
- activity volume reduced significantly
- heavy lifting paused

#### supplements & electrolytes during extended fasting

- sodium: prevents dizziness and low blood pressure
- potassium: supports nerve and muscle function
- magnesium: reduces cramps, supports sleep and stress
- electrolytes must be sugar-free

#### optional

- black coffee or plain tea (cautiously)
- bone broth (technically breaks fast but improves safety)

#### rules

- do not stack extended fasting with intense training
- fasting days: walking or light zone 2 only
- fed days: lift heavy, train hard

### supplements (minimalist, focused list)

#### core vitamins

- vitamin d: immune, mood, bone health
- vitamin b12: nerve function, energy metabolism
- folate (b9): cell division, neurological health
- vitamin c: antioxidant, collagen synthesis
- vitamin a (food preferred): vision, immune health
- vitamin e: antioxidant support
- vitamin k2: calcium regulation, bone and vascular health

#### minerals

- magnesium (glycinate or threonate): sleep, stress, muscle relaxation
- zinc: immune and hormone function
- iron: oxygen transport (supplement only if deficient)
- iodine: thyroid support
- selenium: thyroid enzymes, antioxidant systems
- potassium: electrolyte balance (prefer food sources)

#### fatty acids

- omega-3s (epa/dha): cardiovascular, brain, inflammation balance

#### protein & amino acids

- adequate dietary protein first
- protein powders for convenience only
- creatine monohydrate: strength, cognition, aging support
- glycine: sleep quality, connective tissue support

#### gut support

- fiber from food first
- probiotics short-term, strain-specific
- prebiotics to support existing microbiome

#### rules

- food first, supplements last
- test when possible, guess less
- avoid stacking dozens of compounds

### mental performance

- attention is a finite resource
- single-tasking beats productivity hacks
- deep work protected by environment design
- digital minimalism as cognitive hygiene

#### environment

- reduce constant noise and notification load
- clean air and ventilation matter more than gadgets
- daylight exposure at workspaces
- ergonomic basics over expensive setups

### tracking & wearables

- tools for pattern recognition, not self-surveillance
- trends > daily fluctuations
- sleep regularity > sleep scores
- stop tracking if it increases anxiety

### what fades

- extreme fasting as a lifestyle
- biohacking as identity or flex
- optimization without trade-off awareness
- novelty chasing

### what wins

- boring routines done daily
- recovery as performance
- muscle + heart + mitochondria as priorities
- sustainability over intensity

### bottom line

the best biohack is not adding more

it is removing friction, noise, and self-inflicted stress

lift weights, protect sleep, move daily, recover hard

consistency beats sophistication every time
