## specs
- model: omega50 rev.b
- layout: 50% (5×12, 58 keys)
- case: 3d-printed, white
- pcb: hot-swap (usb + bluetooth)
- firmware: qmk

## components
- alpha keys: gateron white (linear, ~35 g)
- stabilized keys: ttc silent moon white (linear, silent, ~42 g)
- acoustics: poron internal foam + silencing rings
- keycaps: pbt blank (no legends), oil-resistant

## build process
- install pcb stabilizers & flash qmk firmware
- place poron dampening foam between pcb and case
- mount pcb into 3d-printed case
- insert switches & install silencing rings
- install blank pbt keycaps
- configure layers and navigation in qmk
- tune debounce settings for light actuation

## notes
- light switches benefit from the added stability of pcb mounting
- poron foam effectively mutes mid-frequency resonance
- mixed switch weights provide better control for larger keys
