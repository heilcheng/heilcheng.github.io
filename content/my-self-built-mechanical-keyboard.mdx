## model
- omega50 rev.b

## layout
- 50% (5×12, 58 keys)

## case
- 3d-printed, white

## pcb
- hot-swap
- usb + bluetooth

## firmware
- qmk

## switches
- alpha keys
  - gateron white
  - linear, ~35 g actuation
- stabilized keys
  - ttc silent moon white
  - linear, silent, ~42 g actuation

## acoustics
- poron internal foam
- switch silencing rings
- reduced resonance
- muted bottom-out

## keycaps
- pbt
- blank (no legends)
  - aesthetic minimalism
- oil-resistant
- smooth, consistent feel

## how it was built
- parts
  - omega50 rev.b pcb
  - 3d-printed case (white)
  - poron dampening foam
  - hot-swap sockets
  - pcb stabilizers
  - gateron white switches (~35 g)
  - ttc silent moon white switches (~42 g)
  - pbt blank keycaps
- assembly
  - flash qmk firmware to pcb
  - install pcb stabilizers
  - place poron foam between pcb and case
  - mount pcb into case
  - insert switches (hot-swap)
    - gateron white: alpha keys
    - ttc silent moon white: stabilized keys
  - install silencing rings
  - install keycaps
- configuration
  - define layers in qmk
  - remap navigation via layers
  - tune debounce for light switches
  - test bluetooth and usb modes

## notes
- light linear switches require stable pcb mounting
- poron foam reduces mid-frequency resonance
- mixed switch weights improve control on large keys
