# eataly

## the golden rules
- no pineapple on pizza (it is considered a culinary crime)
- no chicken on pasta (keep the protein separate or use cured meats)
- no cappuccino after 11am (milk is for breakfast, espresso is for digestion)
- italian cuisine is unesco heritage, focusing on simplicity and seasonal ingredients

## the carbonara manifesto
- use guanciale (pig cheek) instead of pancetta for the proper fat content and funk
- pecorino romano is the traditional cheese of choice for roman pasta
- no cream allowed: the sauce is an emulsion of egg yolks, cheese, and pasta water
- pasta water is liquid gold; use it to bind the sauce to the noodles

## pasta shapes and logic
- shape determines the sauce: never choose a shape at random
- bucatini: thick with a hole in the middle, perfect for capturing oils and nutty sauces
- orecchiette: "little ears" designed to scoop up small vegetable bits like cima di rapa
- rigatoni: the ridges (rigate) are meant to catch thick, chunky meat sauces
- fresh vs dried: fresh pasta is for silkiness; dried pasta is for the perfect al dente bite

## the art of dining
- traditional structure: antipasto, primo (pasta/risotto), secondo (meat), contorno (veg)
- fare la scarpetta: use a small piece of bread to wipe the remaining sauce off your plate
- water and wine only: soda is rarely seen on a traditional dinner table
- digestivo: end with a shot of espresso or a bitter liqueur to help with digestion

## pizza knowledge
- margherita: representing the flag with basil (green), mozzarella (white), and tomato (red)
- marinara: the oldest and simplest style—just tomato, garlic, and oregano (no cheese!)
- cornicione: the puffy outer rim should have "leopard spots" from high-heat wood firing
- dough is king: the quality of the crust is more important than the number of toppings

## shopping and sourcing
- visit mercato gourmet (wan chai/hk) for authentic imports and high-quality cheeses
- buy parmigiano reggiano in chunks to preserve the crystalline texture
- look for nduja (spicy spreadable pork) to add a kick to pasta or pizza
- pane toscano: traditionally saltless bread, made specifically to balance salty sauces
