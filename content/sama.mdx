- most people start wanting money
- many end up wanting to build something meaningful
- outlier success usually comes after baseline success
- these ideas still apply to almost everyone

## 1. compound yourself
- compounding is magic
- look for exponential growth, not linear progress
- choose careers and projects where learning and impact accelerate over time
  - avoid paths where 2 years = 20 years of experience
- use leverage: capital, technology, brand, networks, people
- aim to add another zero to your definition of success
  - let go of small opportunities for step-change ones
- think long-term when others don’t
  - trust the exponential, be patient

## 2. have almost too much self-belief
- self-belief is a force multiplier
  - most successful people believe in themselves almost to delusion
- strong conviction enables contrarian thinking
- managing morale requires confidence
  - ambition attracts resistance
- balance self-belief with self-awareness
  - treat criticism as potentially true, then decide
  - truth-seeking separates confidence from delusion

## 3. learn to think independently
- original thinking is rarely taught
  - schools reward conformity, not creativity
- think from first principles
- generate ideas and test them quickly in the real world
- failure is expected; being right once matters
  - grit comes from solving “unsolvable” problems repeatedly

## 4. get good at sales
- belief alone is not enough
- all great careers involve persuasion
  - you must sell to customers, hires, investors, media
- clear thinking leads to clear communication
  - written communication is especially valuable
- selling what you believe in feels right
- sales is learnable with practice
  - show up in person when it matters

## 5. make it easy to take risks
- people overestimate risk and underestimate reward
- early career is the best time to take risks
- aim for asymmetric bets: lose 1x, win 100x
- comfort makes risk-taking harder
  - avoid lifestyle inflation
  - keep life cheap and flexible when possible

## 6. focus
- focus multiplies effort
- choosing the right problem matters more than hours worked
  - most work people do doesn’t matter
- once priorities are clear, execute aggressively
  - speed correlates strongly with success

## 7. work hard
- smart or hard gets you to top 10%
- smart and hard gets you to top 1%
- extreme effort produces extreme results
  - momentum compounds
- meaningful work is often energizing
- working hard is not shameful
- stamina predicts long-term success
  - work hardest early when compounding is strongest
- avoid burnout by liking the work and the people

## 8. be bold
- hard problems attract better people
- ambition creates tailwinds
- don’t downscale your goals to match trends
- follow curiosity
  - exciting problems attract support

## 9. be willful
- the world bends more than people expect
  - most people don’t push hard enough
- ask for what you want
- rejection is normal
  - persistence creates room for luck
- optimism is required
  - pessimists rarely achieve extreme success

## 10. be hard to compete with
- scarcity creates value
  - if others can do what you do, they eventually will
- build leverage through:
  - personal relationships
  - personal brand
  - cross-domain expertise
- avoid mimetic behavior
  - differentiation matters

## 11. build a network
- great work requires teams
- networks limit or expand what you can do
- help people generously over time
- take care of collaborators
  - share upside generously
- push people to grow, not to burn out
- define yourself by strengths, not weaknesses
  - hire complementary people
- look for rate of improvement, not credentials
  - ask: is this person a force of nature?
- spend time with people who support your ambitions

## 12. you get rich by owning things
- salaries rarely create extreme wealth
- ownership creates upside
  - equity scales; time does not
- own things that grow rapidly in value
- build things people want at scale

## 13. be internally driven
- external validation leads to safe, consensus paths
  - it distorts risk assessment
  - smart people are especially vulnerable
- internal motivation sustains long-term excellence
  - the best people aim to impress themselves
- obsession is required for extreme success
- success eventually becomes doing excellent work that matters to you

## closing thought
- opportunity is unevenly distributed
- luck matters more than people admit
- progress is still possible without privilege
- long-term belief, effort, and persistence matter
- start as early as you can
