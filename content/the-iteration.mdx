### Reality & Existence

- to live fully is to embrace uncertainty
- we suffer more in imagination than in reality
- man is condemned to be free
- one must have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star
- reality > narrative
- excellence is not an act but a habit

### Intelligence & Agency

- the measure of intelligence is the ability to change
- difficulty is just novelty
- how capable you are depends on where your fav dopamine hit comes from
- if you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking
- no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself

### Biological Foundations

- to live fully is to seek your own equilibrium (homeostasis)
- exposure to novelty rewires neurons (neuroplasticity)
- fasted state boosts cellular repair (autophagy mechanisms, 2016 nobel prize in medicine)
- the gut shapes thought as much as the brain does (gut-brain axis)
- meditation and movement optimize mind and body (neuroplasticity + systemic resilience)
